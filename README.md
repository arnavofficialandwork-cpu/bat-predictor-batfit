## 🧩 How It Works

1. Player fills in their profile — height, age, budget, batting style, strength, weakness etc.
2. Frontend sends the data to the backend via a `POST /players` request
3. Backend scores every bat in the database against the player's profile
4. Top 3 bats are returned with a **compatibility percentage**
5. Player can view their profile card, bat recommendations, and download a full report
